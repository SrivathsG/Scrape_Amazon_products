<h1> Product info scraper</h1>
<h3>Scrape information about any product along with its customer reviews into a data frame with just a link of the product.</h3><p> Scraping information may be very difficult when it comes to several big e-commerce websites. Such websites employ several anti-bots to block the traditional scraping methods. However, it is not completely impossible to aggregate their data. Here I have scripted this notebook with few counter-positive measures based on their algorithms to establish API calls with a perfectly working 200 status code for every call.
